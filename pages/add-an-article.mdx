# Add an article

If you'd like to bring in a new article:

1. AMAZING! THANK YOU!

2. Visit Github (top right), fork the repo, draw something up, and submit it a PR.

TODO: I'm planning on making a few Github issue templates to make things easier. One for asking for a new word, one for adding in a new word, maybe a couple others. Feel free to submit a new word as some markdown in a GH issue if it makes it easier for you to contribute.
