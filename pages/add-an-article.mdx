# Add or edit an article

If you'd like to bring in a new article:

1. AMAZING! THANK YOU!

2. Visit Github (top right), fork the repo, draw something up, and submit a PR.

TODO: I'm planning on making a few Github issue templates to make things easier. One for asking for a new word, one for adding in a new word, maybe a couple others. Feel free to submit a new word as some markdown in a GH issue if it makes it easier for you to contribute.

## I don't want to mess with Github. Can I still add or edit an article?

This site isn't directly editable. This sort of plays into the idea that it should be developers writing these articles and addressing them to non-technicals. If you are a non-technical, feel free to reach out to me through the mediums on <Link href="/request-an-article">Request an Article</Link> and I'll work with you on what we can do. ðŸ˜€
