# Tech for Non-Technicals

# Development for Non-Developers

Hello and welcome to the handbook for non-developers and non-technicals to get inside the minds of developers.

As I started my work at Vercel, I noticed that it is often difficult for non-developers to get inside the hearts and minds of devs. It's an awkward hat to put on when you don't know what it's like to write code every day.

I want to create a place for non-technicals to be able to understand us technicals. To speak our language and know why we care about the things that we care about.

Okay, or just to have a convenient reference so you can sell Vercel products. Either way.

## Why I Care

There are so many unbelievable, amazing products out there that deserve more attention - small and large.

But developers are a particularly persnickety bunch. I personally think we as devs get a little bitter when we have an electric piece of sand yell at us all day like "ERROR: YOU DID A BAD THING AND YOU NEED TO FIX IT RIGHT NOW OR I WILL NOT COOPERATE ANYMORE" - but I digress.

They make snap decisions about tools and their first impressions of things can ruin their intepretation of a tool, service, or company for excruciatingly bad reasons.

If only they had been able to get past the fact that the first sentence of the marketing page incorrectly said "Use _the_ CDN today" instead of "Use _a_ CDN today".
(Yes, developers really will not use a tool because of things like this. They will assume that the company doesn't know their stuff and shy away. Really it was just that Jimmy from Accounting thought he would be helpful and update some copy and nobody happened to catch it.)

The problem is: **They miss out on great tools because of this.**

## What This App Solves

I don't want that to happen anymore.

Marketer, I want you to write an ad about headless components and genuinely know what you are talking about.

Sales, when you tell a company that you'll cut down their compile times by 37%, I want you to actually know what that means. Maybe even a little bit of how it works.

Designer, I want your pretty picture to truly capture the essence of what that technology is for and why we (re: developers) care about it.

Less mistakes.

Less toil.

More understanding.

More production.

## What This App Doesn't Solve

I won't be going into deep dives on why developers make certain decisions in certain situations too much. Unless I am asked to do so enough, I will stick to simply telling you what things are and giving you a **very topical** explanation of why developers use/like that *thing*.

Developers love to get into spirited debates about even the most simple things. We're not going to do that here. We're only going to get familiar with the basics, provide a talking point or two about why a dev is supposed to like the *thing*, and then let you get back to work on your business tasks.
