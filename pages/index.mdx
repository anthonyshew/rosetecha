# Development for Non-Developers

Hello and welcome to the handbook for non-developers and non-technicals to get inside the minds of developers.

As I started my work at Vercel, I noticed that it is often difficult for non-developers to get inside the hearts and minds of devs. It's a difficult hat to put on when you don't know what it's like to write code every day.

## Why I Care

There are so many unbelievable, amazing products out there that deserve more attention - small and large.

Developers are a particularly persnickety bunch. They make snap decisions about tools and their first impressions of things can really sully their intepretation of a tool.

The problem is: **They miss out on great tools because of this.**

If only they had been able to get past the fact that the first sentence of the marketing page incorrectly said "Use *the* CDN today" instead of "Use *a* CDN today".
(Yes, developers really will not use a tool because of things like this. They will assume that the company doesn't know the product and shy away.)

## What This App Solves

I don't want that to happen anymore.

Dear marketer, I want you to write an ad about headless components and genuinely know what you are talking about.
Dear sales, when you tell a company that you'll cut down their compile times by 37%, I want you to actually know what that means.

Less mistakes. Less toil. More understanding. More production.
