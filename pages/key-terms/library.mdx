# Library

A library is a set of code that can be downloaded and made a part of your own application.

## Why developers like libraries

There are common tasks in programming that can be written once and then re-used over and over.

The code that gets re-used is probably a `library`.

Instead of re-writing something that has already been written 1,000 times, a developer can download a library to simply have that work done already for them. This increases development velocity and keeps developers happy since they don't have to do the same mundane tasks all the time.
