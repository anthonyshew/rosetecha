# Render

"Rendering" is the process that a browser goes through to paint you the pretty picture of the app that you want to use.

When you visit a web page, there is a bunch of code that has been delivered to you, through the internet, that is pretty meaningless to you as an end user. It is your browser's job to take that code and turn it into something that you can enjoy as a modern web visitor.

The process of turning that code into a painted picture for you is called "rendering." The actal picture itself is called "a render."

## Optimizing renders

There are a lot of tools and tricks at a developer's disposal to optimize the render process. Developers care about this because slow renders look like slow apps for end users. A great amount of effort is spent on making this process as fast as possible.
