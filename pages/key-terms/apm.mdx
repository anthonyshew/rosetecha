# Amazon Performance Monitoring

Application performance monitoring (APM) is the practice of tracking important metrics as they happen when your application is being used.

You can write all of this great, really fast code - but things can not work out like you hoped out in the real world. Using APM, you can understand how things are actually working for your real users.

There are other products in the "Monitoring" space (Sentry, Datadog, etc.). APM is one of them.
