# IaC

IaC stands for "infrastructure as code."

To run a scalable application today, a developer has to be able to deploy their application to the cloud and use a huge amount of puzzle pieces to do it. Deploying a website to the internet is _really_ hard and involves all sorts of settings and configurations.

Those pieces can be tuned by hand - or they can be written as code.

IaC solutions allow developers to write code that describes the "state of the architecture" so that they can deploy this specific set of infrastructure over and over again. There are many benefits beyond this repeatability - but we only need to know the basics here.

Write code. Have infrastructure.
