- Coupling/coupled: How closely tied together the infrastructure is for a frontend and backend. If a frontend and backend are deployed on the same server, they have to be deployed always at the same time in lockstep with each other.

- Decoupling/decoupled: The opposite. Now the frontend can deploy without the backend getting touched and vice versa. The frontend and the backend are two halves that come together to make a whole and only depend on each other where absolutely necessary. They can be used independently from one another.
