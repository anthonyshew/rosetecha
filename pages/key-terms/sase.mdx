# SASE

SASE stands for "secure access service edge."

SASE is a networking security layer. SASE describes a security model (a way of thinking about security) rather than a product or service.

SASE uses a series of firewalls, gateways, and brokers to make sure that a network stays secure against unwanted or invalid traffic.
