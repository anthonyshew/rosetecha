# Distributed Denial of Service

DDoS is a strategy that attackers use to take down a website.

The method is to send a site so much traffic that it can no longer respond. The hacker is overflowing the pipes of a website with so many bogus requests that it can't respond to any of the real requests that it wants to serve.

Vercel offers two types of DDoS protection, you can read about them [here](https://vercel.com/security).
