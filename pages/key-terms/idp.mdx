# IdP

IdP is short for "identity provider."

An identity provider is in charge of identifying who the humans are that are using the machines.

They are more than a password. They usually go way out of their way to install many levels of identification that make it so that even a real user has a hard time logging in. That way, a hacker has a nearly impossible time impersonating someone else.

Many companies will use an IdP to secure their employees' accounts. Vercel Enterprise customers have access to our [SAML single sign-on](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/teams/saml#) feature with these [supported providers](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/teams/saml#supported-providers).
