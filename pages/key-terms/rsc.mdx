# React Server Component

React Server Components (RSC, sometimes) are a technique to strategically <KeyTermLink termUrl="render">render</KeyTermLink> a <KeyTermLink termUrl="react">React</KeyTermLink> component that delivers as much performance to an end user as possible.

A server component is put together before you as a website visitor ever ask for it so you only see the final product of the render rather than the entire process to make it happen.

Server components are an incremental change in the way that frontend developers are striving to get the best perfomance possible on a website.
