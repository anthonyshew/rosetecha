# API

An API is the part of a program that is exposed to other programs.

This is useful when my code needs to interact with some other code for specific reasons.

## Many different contexts

"API" is a more basic concept in programming that gets used in all sorts of contexts. A program that I write is most likely going to be interacting with the outside world so we need ways for our programs to communicate with each other. Those exposure points are the API.

## Some concrete examples

### The Vercel API

The Vercel API allows programmers to create programs (from outside of Vercel) that interact with the Vercel platform. I can, for instance, write a program that takes some code and deploys it on Vercel. That's code sending code to other code and then deploying it.

The Vercel API has a specific set of <KeyTermLink termUrl="endpoint">endpoints</KeyTermLink> that make it so that I can do something specific with a certain endpoints. That set of Vercel's program that I can reach **from the outside** is the API.

### Nextjs

Nextjs has an API that allows me to interact specfically with Nextjs. As long as I follow the rules of the Nextjs framework, the API allows me to tap into the powers of Nextjs. The bits of Nextjs that I can use in my code is the API of Nextjs.

### React

React is a <KeyTermLink termUrl="render">rendering</KeyTermLink> <KeyTermLink termUrl="library">library</KeyTermLink> for JavaScript. It provides a really convenient way for me to write JavaScript and have it show up as a web page for my users. To do this, I use React's API. The React API is a set of functions that unlock this ability for me so that I can reach into React and use its greatness.

## A Common Gotcha

For whatever reason, it's common to make the mistake that an API _only_ refers to HTTP RESTful APIs. (If you don't know what that means, that's okay. You're probably not making this mistake.)

However, this isn't the case. Remember: Any time a program has stuff purposefully exposed for other programs to use, that's an API.
