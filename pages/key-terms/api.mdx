# API

An API is the part of a program that is exposed to other programs.

This is useful when my code needs to interact with some other code for specific reasons.

## Many different contexts

"API" is a more basic concept in programming that gets used in all sorts of contexts. A program that I write is most likely going to be interacting with the outside world so we need ways for our programs to communicate with each other. Those exposure points are the API.

## Some concrete examples

### The Vercel API

The Vercel API allows programmers to create programs (outside of Vercel) that interact with the Vercel platform. I can, for instance, write a program that takes some code and deploys it in Vercel. That's code sending code to other code and then deploying it.

The Vercel API has <KeyTermLink termUrl="endpoint">endpoints</KeyTermLink> that make it so that I can touch those endpoints and have some useful things happen. The parts of Vercel that I can reach from the outside is the API.

### Nextjs

Nextjs has an API that allows me to do stuff specfically with Nextjs. As long as I follow the rules of the Nextjs framework, the API allows me to tap into the powers of Nextjs. The bits of Nextjs that I can interact with is the API of Nextjs.

### React

React is a rendering library for JavaScript. It provides a really convenient way for me to write JavaScript and have it show up as a web page for my users. To do this, I use React's API. The React API is a set of functions that unlock this ability for me so that I can reach into React and use its greatness.

## A Common Gotcha

For whatever reason, it's common to make the mistake that an API *only* refers to HTTP RESTful APIs. (If you don't know what that means, that's okay. You're probably not making this mistake.)

However, this isn't the case. Remember: Any time a program has stuff purposeful exposed for other programs to use, that's the API for that program.
