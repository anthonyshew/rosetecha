# SCIM

SCIM stands for "system for cross-domain identity management."

In short, SCIM is a strategy to move users throughout the code in a way that is fast, cheap, and dependable. SCIM is a strategy rather than a product.

SCIM is a set of ideas that describe how users can be managed in the cloud so that they are understandable for all developers that are working within the system.
