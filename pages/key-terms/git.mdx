# git

git is a way for programmers to mix their code together from different computers so that they can work on the same codebase at the same time.

How git works is written about in <KeyTermLink termUrl="version-control">the version control page</KeyTermLink>. You'll find the problems and solutions there.

There are many version control alternatives to git but git is by far the biggest one.

## Why git matters to Vercel

When a developer wants to push new code into the company's <KeyTermLink termUrl="repository">repository</KeyTermLink>, they will do so using git.

Vercel is built to spectate on that repository and deploy the code that is pushed into that repository automatically. That way, developers know that, when they push code, they will get a new deployment where they can see how that code is working.
