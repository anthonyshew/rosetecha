# Next.js

Next.js is a <KeyTermLink termUrl="react">React</KeyTermLink> framework packed full of tons of features that developers love.

Next.js makes it easier to create a production grade application by making it so I have to write less code and get the same (or) outcomes for my app.

## Stuff Next.js handles for me

These are features of Next.js that, without it, I would have to handle myself. Everything on this list is something that nearly every application needs. So, Next.js is going to handle it for me so I don't have to worry about it.

- User Interface - how users will consume and interact with your application.
- Routing - how users navigate between different parts of your application.
- Data Fetching - where your data lives and how to get it.
- Rendering - when and where you render static or dynamic content.
- Integrations - what third-party services you use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how you connect to them.
- Infrastructure - where you deploy, store, and run your application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc).
- Performance - how to optimize your application for end-users.
- Scalability - how your application adapts as your team, data, and traffic grow.
- Developer Experience - your team's experience building and maintaining your application.

## What is life like without Next.js?

Without Next.js, I have to handle all of the stuff in the list above myself. And that's really annoying. It would be the same code over and over again that I would have to re-write every time I need to make a new app.

Instead, I can use Next.js and I can start on the features that differentiate my product instantly. And that's awesome.
