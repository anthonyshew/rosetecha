# Configuration

Configuration ("config", for short) is like settings for a website or application.

To make software run on a computer, developers often have to provide a list of settings for the computer so that it knows how to use the instructions that are specific to my software.

## A Metaphor

Imagine that you've just downloaded an app onto your phone.

Now, imagine that the first time you tried to open that app, you had to go into the settings of your phone and set the vibration setting to a certain number for the app to be able to run.

That would be an example of "configuration."

## Zero configuration: The Holy Grail

In development, we strive for a zero configuration experience.

Just like how it would be annoying to have to set your vibration to a certain number before you could use your newly downloaded up, it's preetty obnoxious to have to tune a computer before it will run your software.
