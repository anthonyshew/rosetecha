# IDS

IDS stands for "Instrusion Detection System."

An IDS is responsible for identifying internet traffic that doesn't belong on a specific network. If it finds out that someone is accessing a place on the web that it isn't supposed to, the IDS will report that vulnerability to the owners of the application.

Another important characteristic of IDPs is that they _don't actually block the offending traffic_. Instead, all they do is analyze the malicious traffic and make sure that you know about it.
