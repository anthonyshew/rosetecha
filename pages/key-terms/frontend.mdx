The beautiful part of an application that you know and love.

This is the part of the stack that you recognize as "the app."" It has buttons to push, text to read, and the company logo.

There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes of a real world application. But, for end users, this is the part they care about. This is the part they touch, interact with, and know.
