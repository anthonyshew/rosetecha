# What's in here?

This is where I've defined key terms that you'll need to know about programming.

There's so much jargon. SO MUCH JARGON in programming.

It's hard to keep it all straight. It's even worse that the same word can mean several different things depending on the context.

If you ever find a word that you're not so sure about, hopefully you can find it in this key terms section. If not, feel free to let me know.
