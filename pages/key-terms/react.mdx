## Why Developers Like React

### Powerful

React is powerful enough to handle tons of code for me that paints the pretty pictures for my site users.

### Huge community

If React doesn't accomplish exactly what you want it to, someone else has probably made another <KeyTermLink termUrl="library">library</KeyTermLink> that works with React to do the job that you are looking for.

This also means that there is a really good chance that, if you run into a problem with React, someone else has also probably had the same problem and answered it - so you should be able to find the answer on Google.

### Easy to Start

Getting started with React is generally pretty easy. This lets a lot of people in the door so they can get started with React quickly.

(React is pretty hard to master, however.)
