# Multirepo

Code being kept in many different <KeyTermLink termURL="repository">repositories</KeyTermLink> to keep it in smaller, more manageable chunks. This is called a `multirepo`.

## Why?

As a company grows, its needs change. More staff needs to get hired, more features and products need to get built, and, because of this, there is more code.

In these large companies, there can end up being so much code that it becomes really difficult to keep it all in one repository. Things start to perform poorly because _there's just too much darn code_. Builds, pipelines, and <KeyTermLink termUrl="version-control">version control</KeyTermLink> can all start to suffer from the sheer mass of code.

For that reason, a team may want to break up their codebase into many, smaller codebases for ease of management. They just leveraged a `multirepo`.

## Why not?

The alternative to a `multirepo` is a <KeyTermLink termUrl="monorepo">monorepo</KeyTermLink>. For smaller teams and companies that don't have a gigantic codebase, it can be much easier to have just one codebase to use and look at.

However, a monorepo can also be used by larger teams, too. This choice carries huge implications with it and is not taken lightly by programmers, teams, or companies.
