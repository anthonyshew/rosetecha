# OWASP

OWASP is a non profit organization that is dedicated to improving the security of software. They lead open-source software efforts, hold events for developers to learn more about security, and are well respected in the software community.

They are well-known for [the OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) - a list that they create to talk about the most common, most important vulnerabilities that they see during their work throughout a given year. A new list is published every year as they try to continue moving the security world forward.

For more information, see [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/).
