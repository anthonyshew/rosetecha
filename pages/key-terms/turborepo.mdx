# Turborepo

Turborepo is a monorepo manager for building JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Turbo allows a developer to make many different applications using shared code (called packages).

## Uh, what?

Alright, let me try that again.

If you don't know what a monorepo is yet, go check the definition for that one first.

Okay, welcome back.

Now that a developer has bunch of code in a monorepo, they can (theoretically) have an easier time working with the products they are supposed to be building.

However, once there starts being a ton of code, it becomes really difficult to keep everything straight. There ends up being a ton of overhead for making everything work together properly.

## Here comes Turbo

This is where Turbo comes in. Turbo takes all of the pieces and parts of the codebase and pastes them together so that you can have a workflow that you don't have to worry about. This applies to while the app is being developed, built, and ran. Here, Turbo is making it significantly easiser to work in a monorepo.

## More Advanced Features of Turbo

There are many more advanced functions of Turborepo but the big one is "remote caching."

Let's break that down:
- Remote: Somewhere else other than where we are right now.
- Caching: Saving things for later.

What remote caching does is speeds up workflows all over the place. Turbo has a bunch of juice packed into it that allows it to report to a caching server in the cloud where it will remember what builds look like. The first time that it sees a certain build happen, it will go ahead and do that build process. However, the second time it sees that same build happening, it will stop the building process and grab the "old" one that already exists. So, instead of me having to wait for the build process to happen again for the exact same build, I'm going to have it instantly!
