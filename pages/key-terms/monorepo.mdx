# Monorepo

Code is kept in something called a "repository." You can think of a repository ("repo" for short) as a box that holds code. Developers can pick up that box and move it other places, create duplicates of the box, or create new versions of it as they need to.

A monorepo, specifically, is if you took every ounce of code for an entire company and stuffed it into the same repository.

## That makes sense. How else would you do it?

Today, there are gigantic organizations managing billions of lines of code with tens and even hundreds of products. Sometimes, they decide that it is too difficult to keep all of their code in one place.

Instead of creating a monorepo, they will instead use multirepos. As you can imagine, this means taking the code and putting it in several different boxes.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both of these approaches. Teams decide on which strategy to use based on their specific situation and how they want to work.

## Why would you use a monorepo?

Monorepos make sense for smaller businesses with fewer products. A monorepo is almost always easier to manage since all of the required code can live in one place. So, to have less to deal with, a monorepo can make sense. Teams can find themselves working faster, building faster, and delivering value faster.
