# PII

PII stands for "personally identifiable information."

You can understand PII as "anything that can be used to know who a person is on the internet." Whether that be a name, phone number, birthday, or any other piece of information (or set of information!) that lets you know who someone is.

This is important as companies will have different requirements around PII depending on their security standards and how their data works.
